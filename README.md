# Car Management System

## ðŸ“Œ Description
This is a C++ application that manages car records using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and data structures.  
The system allows the user to:
- Add new car records
- Display all cars

Car records are saved to a file so that information is preserved between program runs.

## ðŸ’» Key Concepts Practiced
- Object-Oriented Programming (C++ classes and objects)
- Data structures (e.g. arrays or linked lists â€” specify based on your code)
- File handling (writing and reading car data to/from a text file)
- Menu-driven console interface

## âš™ Features
- Add a car (record is stored in a file)
- View car list (read and display data from the file)

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `car.cpp` â€” main program logic
- `car.h` â€” class definition
- `cars.txt` â€” file that stores car records

## ðŸš€ How to run
Compile:
